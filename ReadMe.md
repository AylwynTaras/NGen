# NGen
#Project On Hold

Due to this engine doubling as a platform for my coursework I am forced to halt all progress here until the end of the school year. New features currently include a 3D Camera system, an object component system, and components featuring Meshes, States, and RigidBodies.

## Description

A 3D Game / Simulation API for the C programming language.

Rapidly create complex 3D graphical games and simulations. Working similarly to XNA, NGen strives to be a quickstart to advanced 3D games. By planning to provide engine components ready to manage input, rendering, collisions, physics, menus, game objects, and states you can rapidly create games and simulations without any of the performance drawbacks of easy to learn languages or libraries.

## Dependencies

OpenGL
- https://www.opengl.org/

Freeglut
- http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

## Build

NGen is compiled using MinGw's gcc compiler. After installing freeglut you can compile the program from the top-level project directory by entering the following command:

Windows:
> mingw32-make

Linux/Mac:
> make

The Makefile will take care of the rest. You can then run the project with:
> NGen

## Installation

Simply download the project, extract to it's own folder if necessary, and then follow the instructions in the Build section. No other installation steps are needed.

## Using the NGen

As engine components are added I will be updating this section with examples of how you can use them.

### Math

ToDo: Provide an example of how to utilize the NGen's Matrix and Vector mathematics library.
